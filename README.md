## Module 10: Repository Project/Part B

### Goal
The goal of this repository is to create a sample database to store digital assets. Although widely available online, digital assets can be taken down by sites or creators at any time. Game developers, architects, interior designers, and other professionals may find value in creating personal digital repositories to store frequently used 3D models and assets.

### Notes
The repository is organized into three categories of assets including Rooms, Decor, and Furniture. Within each subfolder there are README files containing meta data, download links, and images.

### Meta Data
