# Digital-Design Project

## Module 10: Repository Project/Part B

Tasks
- Based on the previous module, select a management system to create your own repository. If you choose to use a system different from the ones mentioned in the previous module, make sure to justify your decision.
- Ingest at least 5 items and create metadata for them. 
- Organize the items into at least two levels and that are divided for a purpose (for example: one collections with all five items and two items in a particular exhibit in an archive). This can also look like folders and sub folders, depending on the system.
- Generate a public URL or make your repository. If you used software, create a presentation with screenshots of your repository.
